Samsung Semiconductor India Research, in collaboration with VLSI System Design (VSD), has launched the SAMSUNG-RISCV program. This intensive six-week training program focuses on semiconductor technologies and the RISC-V architecture. Designed to equip participants with advanced knowledge and skills, it aims to meet the demands of the fast-growing semiconductor industry. With a strong emphasis on RISC-V design and its open-source nature, the program provides an excellent opportunity to explore VLSI chip design and innovation in RISC-V technology.

  <summary>Task 2</summary>

Task 2: RISC-V Object dump for both -O1 and -Ofast
Compilation and Optimization: A C program is compiled using the RISC-V GCC compiler with the -O1 and -Ofast optimization flag to observe its performance and efficiency.

Simulation with SPIKE: The compiled binary is executed in the SPIKE RISC-V simulator.

Object Dump Analysis: The RISC-V object dump of the program is generated, showing the disassembled assembly instructions and memory addresses.

  <summary>Task 3</summary>

Task 3: 32-bit Instruction Patterns
Instruction Types
The RISC-V architecture categorizes instructions into six types based on their format:

R-type: Register to Register operations
I-type: Immediate operations
S-type: Store operations
B-type: Branch operations
U-type: Upper immediate operations
J-type: Jump operations
